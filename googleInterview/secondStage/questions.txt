1.
A+B+C <= X
Input Array (Do O(n) solution)

2. Randomly select k winners from a pool of n in O(k) time complexity (Duplicate errors must be solved)
Solve this in the case that:
Large amount of users
Don't know when all possible winners are found yet
Entries come one at a time
Fairness still occurs
Winners can be given right when the end of at 24 hour time period is announced

3. 
Sum of 2D Array at index
a. fast lookup/slow set
b. slow lookup/fast set
c. Speed up set/changing array index + slow down lookup
b. 

4.
a. how would you scale twitter for a lot of users
b. 2D array of integers 1 - n^2 randomly placed
Find longest sequence of numbers that is connected (numbers are connected if adjacent vertically or horizontally)
c. Assembly
STOR A ... R -> A
STOR B ... R -> B
SUB A ... R-A -> R
SUB B ... R-B -> R 

5. TWO
a. friend of friends
	- inserted sort, O(n) iteration through each friend
b. square root of a number to a good degree of significance (iterative)
